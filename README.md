# TTP-Stage-2
Application Build Assessment for TTP Stage 2 (1/2020)

Fullstack assessment:
I made use of  IEX API for stock information.
    Firebase to store user info.

It is by no means complete:
Email authentications was not completed.
Purchasing tickers throws error when ticker is invalid but no notification to user.
When purchasing additional tickers (already owned), tickers just repeat instead of adding to existing tickers.
Dates for purchasing have not been formatted.
